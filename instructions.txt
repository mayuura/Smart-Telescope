    Azimuth Adjustment (Horizontal Adjustment):

        The azimuth adjustment refers to the telescope's left-right movement (in azimuth) to center the object.

        To calculate the azimuth adjustment in degrees, you can use the following formula:
            Azimuth Adjustment (degrees) = (Angular Separation (arcseconds) / Telescope Field of View (arcseconds per degree))

        The telescope's field of view is crucial. It represents how many arcseconds correspond to one degree of movement in azimuth. For example, if your telescope has a field of view of 60 arcseconds per degree, and you have an angular separation of 120 arcseconds, the azimuth adjustment would be 2 degrees to the east if the separation is positive, and 2 degrees to the west if it's negative.

    Altitude Adjustment (Vertical Adjustment):

        The altitude adjustment refers to the telescope's up-down movement (in altitude) to center the object.

        Calculate the altitude adjustment in degrees based on the angular separation:
            Altitude Adjustment (degrees) = (Angular Separation (arcseconds) / 3600)

        The division by 3600 is used to convert arcseconds to degrees. For example, if the angular separation is 65 arcseconds, the altitude adjustment would be approximately 0.0181 degrees.

    Provide Clear Instructions:
        Now that you have calculated both the azimuth and altitude adjustments in degrees, you can provide clear instructions to the user based on these values:
            "Adjust the telescope's azimuth by [Azimuth Adjustment] degrees to the [east/west]."
            "Change the telescope's altitude by [Altitude Adjustment] degrees to center the object."
