Smart Telescope : a companion app that is meant to make stargazing easier.Using gps and sensor data , the app gives the user a list of observable objects and the relevant instructions to help him observe the chosen object from his telescope.
App  : android app has 3 activitites : 
-home activity which gives a description of the app and has a getting started button . 
-Telescope mount activity to choose the mount of the telescope (the choice controls the output of the app)
-Main activity : gets data from the sensor via ble (not integrated yet but the ble communication protocol is set up and the real time data display is working , tested on a seperate activity ), and gets
the current gps location and uses them to query to two seperate databases to get relevant data on observable celestial objects (relevant data changes based on your mount).After the query , you get a list of celestial object that are observable
and upon choosing one from the list you get relevant data that help you observe it .
Bonus : Ble activity is a test activity created to test the ble protocol and real time data display but it is custom made for my device(to test on another device change the device_A_address attribute) . It is not a classic scanner/control activity .The activity has a button , and 2 text views. but upon clicking on the connect button 
an automatic connection is initiated to my device , and the first textview is updated to show the connection status . When connection is established , notifications (remote and local ) are enabled , and the second textview displays the real time data.
