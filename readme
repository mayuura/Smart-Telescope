# Smart Telescope
A companion app that is meant to make stargazing easier. Using GPS and sensor data, the app gives the user a list of observable objects and the relevant instructions to help him observe the chosen object from his telescope.

## App
The Android app has 3 activities:

- **Home Activity**: Gives a description of the app and has a "Getting Started" button.
- **Telescope Mount Activity**: Allows the user to choose the mount of the telescope (the choice controls the output of the app).
- **Main Activity**: Gets data from the sensor via BLE (not integrated yet but the BLE communication protocol is set up and the real-time data display is working, tested on a separate activity), and gets the current GPS location and uses them to query two separate databases to get relevant data on observable celestial objects (relevant data changes based on your mount). After the query, you get a list of celestial objects that are observable and upon choosing one from the list you get relevant data that help you observe it.

## Bonus
The BLE activity is a test activity created to test the BLE protocol and real-time data display but it is custom made for my device (to test on another device change the `device_A_address` attribute). It is not a classic scanner/control activity. The activity has a button, and 2 text views. Upon clicking on the "Connect" button, an automatic connection is initiated to my device, and the first TextView is updated to show the connection status. When the connection is established, notifications (remote and local) are enabled, and the second TextView displays the real-time data.
