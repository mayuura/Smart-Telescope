Topic: Attitude estimation using indirect Kalman filtering

For this, we rely on the paper "Orientation Estimation Using a Quaternion-Based Indirect Kalman Filter With Adaptive Estimation of External Acceleration" by Prof. Young Soo Suh. It is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5462839).
